# Overview {-}

Welcome to the home of the `recount3` project! This website is the home to the most updated version of all the documentation related to the `recount3` project.

**recount3** is an online resource consisting of RNA-seq gene, exon, and exon-exon junction counts as well as coverage bigWig files for *XX* and *YY* different studies for human and mouse respectively. It is the third generation of the [ReCount project](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/recount/).

The raw sequencing data were processed with [`recount-pump`](https://github.com/langmead-lab/recount-pump/) as described in the [recount3 paper](https://biorxiv.org) which created the coverage bigWig files and the recount-unified text files. While these raw output files are available through [SciServer](), for ease of statistical analysis, we provide through the [`recount3`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/recount3) R/Bioconductor package an interface that builds [RangedSummarizedExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/SummarizedExperiment) R objects for gene, exon, and exon-exon junction counts. The coverage bigWig files can be used for annotation-agnostic expression analyses using for example [`derfinder`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/derfinder), [`megadepth`]() and other tools. 

By taking care of several preprocessing steps and combining many datasets into one easily-accessible website, we make finding and analyzing RNA-seq data considerably more straightforward.
