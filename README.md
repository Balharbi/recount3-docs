# recount3-docs 

This GitHub repository is home to the `recount3` documentation. It consists of R Markdown files that generate the [**documentation website**](https://LieberInstitute.github.io/recount3-docs) using the R package [`bookdown`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bookdown) through a GitHub Actions workflow modified from [`biocthis`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/biocthis). This GitHub repository also contains the code for making the recount3 study explorer using the R package [`shiny`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=shiny) that you can view at [shinyapps.io](https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount3-study-explorer/) or embedded on the recount3 documentation website.
