Welcome to the home of the `recount3` project! This website provides an overview of all the pieces that make up the `recount3` project that is a part of [**recount.bio**](https://recount.bio/).

# Overview {-}

**recount3** is an online resource consisting of RNA-seq gene, exon, and exon-exon junction counts as well as coverage bigWig files for 8,679 and 10,088 different studies for human and mouse respectively. It is the third generation of the [ReCount project](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/recount/) and part of [**recount.bio**](https://recount.bio).

The raw sequencing data were processed with the Monorail system as described in the [recount3 paper](TODO) which created the coverage bigWig files and the recount-unified text files. While these raw output files are available through [IDIES SciServer](https://idies.jhu.edu/), for ease of statistical analysis, we provide through the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("recount3")` R/Bioconductor package an interface that builds [RangedSummarizedExperiment](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3252) R objects for gene, exon, and exon-exon junction counts for each study. Furthermore, `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("snapcount")` enables query-based access of the `recount3` and `recount2` data. The coverage bigWig files can be used for annotation-agnostic expression analyses using for example `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("megadepth")`, `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("derfinder")` and other tools. 

By taking care of several pre-processing steps and combining many datasets into one easily-accessible website, we make finding and analyzing RNA-seq data considerably more straightforward.

## Study explorer {-}

```{r "embed_study_explorer", out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_app("https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount3-study-explorer/", 
  height = "2000px")
```

You can also open the study explorer independently through [shinyapps.io](https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount3-study-explorer/).
