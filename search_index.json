This website is the home to the most updated version of all the documentation related to the recount3 project. recount3 is an online resource consisting of RNA-seq gene, exon, and exon-exon junction counts as well as coverage bigWig files for XX and YY different studies for human and mouse respectively. It is the third generation of the ReCount project. The raw sequencing data were processed with recount-pump as described in the recount3 paper which created the coverage bigWig files and the recount-unified text files. While these raw output files are available through SciServer, for ease of statistical analysis, we provide through the recount3 R/Bioconductor package an interface that builds RangedSummarizedExperiment R objects for gene, exon, and exon-exon junction counts. The coverage bigWig files can be used for annotation-agnostic expression analyses using for example derfinder, megadepth and other tools. By taking care of several preprocessing steps and combining many datasets into one easily-accessible website, we make finding and analyzing RNA-seq data considerably more straightforward. Related recount3 websites recount3 is composed of several related software tools and websites. Here is the full list, with all of them referring to this website for their unified documentation. recount-pump: TODO recount-unifier: TODO monorail: TODO megadepth: TODO recount3: R package source, Bioconductor landing page, pkgdown documentation website recount3-docs: the source code for this documentation website.

["data.html", "1 Data 1.1 Human 1.2 Mouse", " 1 Data recount3 provides processed RNA-seq data for human and mouse in file formats similar to recount2 (Figure 1.1), which at its core is based on coverage bigWig files and exon-exon junction counts (see Raw file for more details). These two raw files power the whole recount3 ecosystem. In recount3, we have provided coverage count files for several human and mouse annotations with samples grouped by study. Some large studies, like GTEx and TCGA have been fragmented at the tissue level to make the data more accessible. Figure 1.1: Overview of the data available in recount2 and recount3. Reads (pink boxes) aligned to the reference genome can be used to compute a base-pair coverage curve and identify exon-exon junctions (split reads). Gene and exon count matrices are generated using annotation information providing the gene (green boxes) and exon (blue boxes) coordinates together with the base-level coverage curve. The reads spanning exon-exon junctions (jx) are used to compute a third count matrix that might include unannotated junctions (jx 3 and 4). Without using annotation information, expressed regions (orange box) can be determined from the base-level coverage curve to then construct data-driven count matrices. 1.1 Human Annotations: Gencode v26 Gencode v29 RefSeq FANTOM6_cat ERCC SIRV 1.2 Mouse "],
