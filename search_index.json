This website is the home to the most updated version of all the documentation related to the recount3 project. recount3 is an online resource consisting of RNA-seq gene, exon, and exon-exon junction counts as well as coverage bigWig files for XX and YY different studies for human and mouse respectively. It is the third generation of the ReCount project. The raw sequencing data were processed with recount-pump as described in the recount3 paper which created the coverage bigWig files and the recount-unified text files. While these raw output files are available through SciServer, for ease of statistical analysis, we provide through the recount3 R/Bioconductor package an interface that builds RangedSummarizedExperiment R objects for gene, exon, and exon-exon junction counts. The coverage bigWig files can be used for annotation-agnostic expression analyses using for example derfinder, megadepth and other tools. By taking care of several preprocessing steps and combining many datasets into one easily-accessible website, we make finding and analyzing RNA-seq data considerably more straightforward. 1.1 How to cite recount3 Thank you for your continued support of the ReCount family of projects! We greatly appreciate you citing our work. print(citation(&quot;recount3&quot;)[2], bibtex = TRUE) ## ## Wilks C, Collado-Torres L, Zheng SC, Jaffe AE, Nellore A, Hansen KD, ## Langmead B (2020). &quot;recount3 pre-print title TODO.&quot; _bioRxiv_. doi: ## 10.1101/TODO (URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/TODO), &lt;URL: ## https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/TODO&gt;. ## ## A BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is ## ## @Article{, ## title = {recount3 pre-print title TODO}, ## author = {Christopher Wilks and Leonardo Collado-Torres and Shijie C.

Each phase of the project has had several companion publications that expanded the main resource in different directions.
