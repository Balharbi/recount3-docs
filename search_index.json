This website is the home to the most updated version of all the documentation related to the recount3 project. recount3 is an online resource consisting of RNA-seq gene, exon, and exon-exon junction counts as well as coverage bigWig files for XX and YY different studies for human and mouse respectively. It is the third generation of the ReCount project. The raw sequencing data were processed with recount-pump as described in the recount3 paper which created the coverage bigWig files and the recount-unified text files. While these raw output files are available through SciServer, for ease of statistical analysis, we provide through the recount3 R/Bioconductor package an interface that builds RangedSummarizedExperiment R objects for gene, exon, and exon-exon junction counts. The coverage bigWig files can be used for annotation-agnostic expression analyses using for example derfinder, megadepth and other tools. By taking care of several preprocessing steps and combining many datasets into one easily-accessible website, we make finding and analyzing RNA-seq data considerably more straightforward. Related recount3 websites recount3 is composed of several related software tools and websites. Here is the full list, with all of them referring to this website for their unified documentation. recount-pump: TODO recount-unifier: TODO monorail: TODO megadepth: TODO recount3: R package source, Bioconductor landing page, pkgdown documentation website recount3-docs: the source code for this documentation website.

["data.html", "1 Data 1.1 Human 1.2 Mouse", " 1 Data recount3 provides processed RNA-seq data for human and mouse in file formats similar to recount2 (Figure 1.1), which at its core is based on coverage bigWig files and exon-exon junction counts (see Raw file for more details). These two raw files power the whole recount3 ecosystem. In recount3, we have provided coverage count files for several human and mouse annotations with samples grouped by study. Some large studies, like GTEx and TCGA have been fragmented at the tissue level to make the data more accessible. Figure 1.1: Overview of the data available in recount2 and recount3. Reads (pink boxes) aligned to the reference genome can be used to compute a base-pair coverage curve and identify exon-exon junctions (split reads). Gene and exon count matrices are generated using annotation information providing the gene (green boxes) and exon (blue boxes) coordinates together with the base-level coverage curve. The reads spanning exon-exon junctions (jx) are used to compute a third count matrix that might include unannotated junctions (jx 3 and 4). Without using annotation information, expressed regions (orange box) can be determined from the base-level coverage curve to then construct data-driven count matrices. 1.1 Human Annotations: Gencode v26 Gencode v29 RefSeq FANTOM6_cat ERCC SIRV 1.2 Mouse "],

["quality-check-fields.html", "5 Quality check fields", " 5 Quality check fields We used a number of tools to collect potentially useful quality-control (QC) measures. Specifically, we used seqtk (Li, n.d.), the idxstats subcommand of samtools, the output of STAR, our own megadepth tool, and featureCounts. We examine each in turn, listing the specific QC measures calculated be each. Monorail runs the seqtk fqchk command on input FASTQ files to collect base-quality and base-composition summaries for all sequencing cycles. We distill these into a few QC measures included with every summarized run in recount3. min_len: minimum read length max_len: maximum read length avg_len: average read length #distinct_quality_values: number of different quality scores present in the sequence run’s base qualities #bases: total number of bases across spots (not including both read mates if paired) %A: percent of bases that are A %C: percent of bases that are C %G: percent of bases that are G %T: percent of bases that are T %N: percent of bases that are N avgQ: weighted average over Phred quality scores present in the sequence run, where weights are the Phred quality values themselves errQ: negatively scaled log of the weighted average Phred quality scores present in the sequence run, where weights are the error probabilities associated with the Phred quality scores Monorail uses STAR to align RNA-seq reads in a spliced fashion to a reference genome, without using any annotation. Files output by STAR, particularly the Log.out and Log.final.out, report a number of measures that can be used for QC. We compile these into a number of QC measures included with every summarized run in recount3. Note that some of these measures are reported separately for the two ends of a paired-end read. We omit the second-end versions of these QC measures here for space reasons. From the STAR manual (version 2.7.2b): Log.final.out: summary mapping statistics after mapping job is complete, very useful for quality control. The statistics are calculated for each read (single- or paired-end) and then summed or averaged over all reads. Note that STAR counts a paired-end read as one read, (unlike the samtools flagstat/idxstats, which count each mate separately). Most of the information is collected about the UNIQUE mappers (unlike samtools flagstat/idxstats which does not separate unique or multi-mappers). Each splicing is counted in the numbers of splices, which would correspond to summing the counts in SJ.out.tab. The mismatch/indel error rates are calculated on a per base basis, i.e. as total number of mismatches/indels in all unique mappers divided by the total number of mapped bases. Some of the following definitions include text from the STAR manual/source code, reprinted here for convenience. Please see the STAR manual for more in depth information. %_of_chimeric_reads: Number of chimeric reads divided by number of input reads %_of_reads_mapped_to_multiple_loci: Number of reads mapped to multiple loci divided by number of input reads %_of_reads_mapped_to_too_many_loci: Number of reads mapped to (&gt; 10) loci divided by number of input reads %_of_reads_unmapped:_other: Reads are unmapped due to no acceptable seed/windows divided by number of input reads %_of_reads_unmapped:_too_many_mismatches: Number of reads where best alignment has more mismatches than max allowed number of mismatches divided by number of input reads %_of_reads_unmapped:_too_short: Number of reads where best alignment was shorter than min allowed mapped length divided by number of input reads all_mapped_reads: Total number of reads aligned average_input_read_length: Average length of a read average_mapped_length: Average length of an alignment deletion_average_length: Average length of a genomic deletion, i.e. genomic gaps deletion_rate_per_base: Genomic deletions per mapped base insertion_average_length: Average length of a genomic insertion, i.e. read gaps insertion_rate_per_base: Genomics insertions per mapped base mapping_speed_million_of_reads_per_hour: How fast it was to align this sample mismatch_rate_per_base_%: Mismatches per mapped base number_of_chimeric_reads: Total number of reads which were fragmented on aligning, e.g. fusion potential reads number_of_input_reads: Total number of reads input to STAR number_of_reads_mapped_to_multiple_loci: Number of reads mapped to multiple loci number_of_reads_mapped_to_too_many_loci: Number of reads mapped to (&gt; 10) loci number_of_reads_unmapped:_other: Number of reads left unmapped due to no acceptable seed/windows number_of_reads_unmapped:_too_many_mismatches: Number of reads where best alignment has more mismatches than max allowed number of mismatches number_of_reads_unmapped:_too_short: Number of reads where best alignment was shorter than min allowed mapped length number_of_splices:_at/ac: Number of canonical splices of AT-AC (and reverse) number_of_splices:_annotated_(sjdb): Number of splices found that were also in the annotation database number_of_splices:_gc/ag: Number of canonical splices of GC-AG (and reverse) number_of_splices:_gt/ag: Number of canonical splices of GT-AG (and reverse) number_of_splices:_non-canonical: Number of non-canonical splices, anything not GT-AG, AT-AC, GC-AG, or their reverse complement number_of_splices:_total: Total number of splices uniquely_mapped_reads_%: Number of reads which mapped to a single locus divided by number of input reads uniquely_mapped_reads_number: Number of reads which mapped to a single locus Monorail runs the samtools idxstats on the BAM file output by STAR to collect statistics about how many reads aligned to each chromosome in the genome assembly. This can be helpful in, for instance, confirming the sex of the individual sequenced based on alignments to sex chromosomes, or measuring effectiveness of ribosomal RNA depletion by considering the fraction of reads aligned to the mitochondrial genome. We compile these into a number of QC measures included with every summarized run in recount3: aligned_reads%.chrm: Percent of reads aligning to the mitochondrial genome. aligned_reads%.chrx: Percent of reads aligning to chromosome X. aligned_reads%.chry: Precent of reads aligning to chromosome Y. Monorail runs our megadepth tool on the BAM files output by STAR. The chief function is to convert BAM files to bigWig files that are then added to the recount3 archive. As megadepth performs this conversion, it also summarizes the amount of sequencing coverage within the intervals of a provided BED file representing a gene annotation. These quantifications can be useful for quality control, tell us, for example, what fraction of the coverage is within annotated genes. Fragment length distribution is based on a special read filter only applied for this purpose to be compatible with CSAW’s fragment counting approach (Lun and Smyth 2016), paired reads in a passing fragment must not be secondary, supplementary, have conflicting read order, be unmapped or be mapped on more than one chromosome. The bc_ prefix here refers to the previous name of the Megadepth tool.1 bc_auc.all_reads_all_bases: Area under coverage (total depth of coverage evaluated at all bases) for all alignments bc_auc.all_reads_annotated_bases: Area under coverage for all alignments, but only for bases in annotated exons bc_auc.unique_reads_all_bases: Area under coverage for uniquely aligned reads bc_auc.unique_reads_annotated_bases: Area under coverage for uniquely aligned reads, but only for bases in annotated exons bc_auc.all_%: bc_auc.all_reads_annotated_bases divided by bc_auc.all_reads_all_bases bc_auc.unique_%: bc_auc.unique_reads_annotated_bases divided by bc_auc.unique_reads_all_bases bc_frag.count: Total number of read fragments in BAM after filtering bc_frag.kallisto_count: Number of read fragments (&lt; 1000) bp in length in BAM after filtering bc_frag.kallisto_mean_length: Mean length of read fragments (&lt; 1000) bp in length in BAM after filtering bc_frag.mean_length: Mean length of all read fragments in BAM after filtering bc_frag.mode_length: Mode of the read fragment length of all fragments in BAM after filtering bc_frag.mode_length_count: Number of read fraqments with the bc_frag.mode_length in BAM after filtering Finally, Monorail runs featureCounts on the BAM files output by STAR. This provides a second opinion on the quantifications produced by megadepth. While we have not yet found compelling examples where the megadepth and featureCounts outputs disagree, we keep summaries of the featureCounts quantifications as potential QC measures. exon_fc.all_%: exon_fc_count_all.assigned divided by all_mapped_reads (from STAR) exon_fc.unique_%: exon_fc_count_unique.assigned divided by uniquely_mapped_reads_number (from STAR) exon_fc_count_all.total: Total number of fragments, including multi-mappers, input to featureCounts exon_fc_count_all.assigned: Number of fragments, including multi-mappers, assigned by featureCounts to an exon exon_fc_count_unique.total: Total number of uniquely mapping fragments input to featureCounts exon_fc_count_unique.assigned: Number of uniquely mapping fragments assigned by featureCounts to an exon gene_fc.all_%: gene_fc_count_all.assigned divided by all_mapped_reads (from STAR) gene_fc.unique_%: gene_fc_count_unique.assigned divided by uniquely_mapped_reads_number (from STAR) gene_fc_count_all.total: Total number of fragments, including multi-mappers, input to featureCounts gene_fc_count_all.assigned: Number of fragments, including multi-mappers, assigned by featureCounts to a gene gene_fc_count_unique.total: Total number of uniquely mapping fragments input to featureCounts gene_fc_count_unique.assigned: Number of uniquely mapping fragments assigned by featureCounts to a gene References "],
